The aim of this project is to take an Isometric 3D version of the game Penguin Towers (A Multiplayer game inspired by Morloc Tower from the 1970s,
and expand the touch screen interface so that it can be considered playable on a Tablet Device.

I'll be using this README File to outline all current and future goals to showcase my progress in this project.
It'll be updated with new goals, as well as showcasing what has been completed. Watch this Space

CURRENT GOALS :-
Examine the current files to detect what progress has been currently made and what is missing.
Play around with the demo to see what the current UI looks like.
Research for tools to expand the touch screen interface.
Research for tools to allow the game to run on a Tablet based OS (Android most likely).

Please see doc/penguin-tower.info, doc/ptower.texi, doc/ptower.html or
