This is the Dissertation for Uni of South Wales Student No. 14040859.

The aim of this project is to take an Isometric 3D version of the game Penguin Towers (A Multiplayer game inspired by Morloc Tower from the 1970s),
and expand the touch screen interface so that it can be considered playable on a Tablet Device.

I'll be using this README File to outline all current and future goals to showcase my progress in this project.
It'll be updated with new goals, as well as showcasing what has been completed. Watch this Space

30/01/2019:-

Layout wise, the current program has orientation in the bottom right
Movement forward using a 9 digit numpad in the bottom left.
Top Right has the "Power" Button,
Top Left has other functions like mouse/tablet mode, signal strength etc.

The image "RoughDesign.jpg" showcases a rough design for the layout (Wrote on the whiteboard in J106) for the UI.
The design is movement in the bottom left, items in the middle, actions such as chest opening or attacks (which switches around),
power remaining in the top right, and space for anything else in the top right.
